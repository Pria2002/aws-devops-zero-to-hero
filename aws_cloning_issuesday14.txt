Issue with Cloning AWS Repository

I'm having trouble cloning an AWS repository into my own GitHub repo. Here are the steps I've been trying to resolve the issue:

1. Check Permissions: Ensure I have access to the AWS CodeCommit or GitHub repository.
2. Correct URL: Verify that I’m using the correct repository URL for cloning. For AWS CodeCommit, it should look like:
    ```
    https://git-codecommit.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repository-name>
    ```
3. Clone Command:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
4. Handle Credential Issues: If I face problems with HTTPS credentials, I'm considering switching to SSH for smoother authentication.
5. Forking and Upstream: If the repo is not mine, I will fork it first and then clone my fork. I’ll add the original as upstream to stay updated:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
    git fetch upstream
    ```

I'm also running the following Bash script to pull a Docker image and run it, which may be relevant to my setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
IMAGE_NAME="your-docker-image-name"
echo "Pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub..."
docker pull "$IMAGE_NAME"
echo "Running the Docker image as a container..."
docker run -d "$IMAGE_NAME"
```

If anyone has advice or solutions for the AWS repository cloning issue, I’d greatly appreciate it!
